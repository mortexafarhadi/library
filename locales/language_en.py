               Programmers, Digital Artists, Graphic Designers, Artists, Collectors, Promoters, Creators & Developers are inseparable members of this field.
               Arttizens has brought together a collection of these professions to be able to meet all the needs of this field. In addition, to build the bridge between these people around the world for their own specific purposes.
               Our goal is to create an effective, efficient and without border communication chain for people who are active in different parts of the field.
               From Arttizens’s point of view ,the framework is annoying; But creating a systematic structure according to specific elements can give direction to the potential and energy of skilled people.
               Our common goal is to integrate art and technology and introduce its true value to the whole world.
               The question is;
               Do you want to be one of these rivers to join this ocean (union)?""",
